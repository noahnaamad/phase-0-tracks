          <p><strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</strong></p>
            <p>Semantic tags specify what that part of the html is to be used for.  For example, an aside tag specifies that the content within that tag are not the main thrust of the webpage and will probably not be centered on the page.</p>

          <p><strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong></p>
          <p>If using only HTML, the browser displays the content by row in the html file.</p>
