          <p><strong>What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?</strong></p>
            <p>Semantic tags specify what that part of the html is to be used for.  For example, an aside tag specifies that the content within that tag are not the main thrust of the webpage and will probably not be centered on the page.</p>

          <p><strong>What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?</strong></p>
          <p>If using only HTML, the browser displays the content by row in the html file.</p>

          <p><strong>What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?</strong></p>
          <p>During this challenge I learned about how to make snippets in Sublime.  Since I'm on Cloud9, I haven't practiced yet, but I'm looking forward to learning more about how to set up snippets.  I think I'm likely to create more snippets at a later date for things used on multiple pages such as headers and footers.</p>

          <p><strong>What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can your understanding of this concept?</strong></p>
          <p>Honestly, the most challenging concept in this challenge is GitHub workflow.  I think that I just need practice troubleshooting when a pull or push doesn't work the way I had hoped, and I think for me the opportunities to practice provided by DBC will be more than enough to teach me to be a competent GitHub user.</p>
