  <h2>Ok sweet, so how do I contra dance?</h2>
  
    <p>Considered a social dance that one can attend without a partner, but is danced in pairs, contra dancing is danced in long lines of couples/pairs formed starting from the stage and down the dance hall. Throughout the course of a dance, couples progress up and down these lines, dancing with each other couple in the line. The dance is led by a caller who teaches the sequence of figures in the dance before the music starts. Callers describe the series of steps called "figures", and in a single dance, a caller may include anywhere from 6 to 12 figures which are repeated as couples progress up and down the lines. Each time through the dance takes 64 beats, after which the pattern is repeated.(<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_dance">source</a>)</p>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Swing Your Partner</td>
        <td>A standard ballroom swing. The couple takes a modified ballroom position, with the follow's left hand on the lead's shoulder, the lead's right hand on the follow's left shoulder blade, their free hands clasped together in the air (experienced dancers often experiment with other ways to place their hands). One can either walk or use a buzz-step; one partner may walk while the other uses the buzz-step. For the buzz-step, the right foot takes only small steps, with the partner's right foot to the right of it. The left foot pushes against the ground repeatedly, moving the dancer in a circle clockwise. Weight is very important in this figure.</td>

        <td>Allemande</td>
        <td>Two dancers join either right or left hands in a thumbs-up, palms-together grip and walk around each other.</td>

      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Do-si-do</td>
        <td>Two dancers begin by facing each other, then move in a clockwise fashion so as to first pass right shoulders ("pass by the right"), then slide back-to-back, then back up, passing left shoulders, to end where they began. Sometimes they do-si-do 1.5 times, exchanging places and ending back-to-back. As an embellishment, experienced dancers will often add a spin while performing this move.</td>
        <td>8 to 12</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Long Lines Forward and Back</td>
        <td>All dancers face toward the dancers across the set from them, and join hands with the dancers beside them to form "long lines" on the sides of the set. These two lines then, in unison (ideally), take four steps together, and then four steps backward.</td>
        <td>8</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Petronella Turn</td>
        <td>Four dancers, equally spaced around a small ring, move into the position of the dancer on their right in four steps while rotating (spinning) individually clockwise 3/4. This movement is adapted from the eponymous dance "Petronella," a traditional contra dance derived from a Scottish country dance of the same name. As a controversial embellishment, the folk process has added a "clap-clap" of hands on beats 3.5 and 4 of the 4-beat movement.</td>
