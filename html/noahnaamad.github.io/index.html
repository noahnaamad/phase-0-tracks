  <h2>Ok sweet, so how do I contra dance?</h2>
  
    <p>Considered a social dance that one can attend without a partner, but is danced in pairs, contra dancing is danced in long lines of couples/pairs formed starting from the stage and down the dance hall. Throughout the course of a dance, couples progress up and down these lines, dancing with each other couple in the line. The dance is led by a caller who teaches the sequence of figures in the dance before the music starts. Callers describe the series of steps called "figures", and in a single dance, a caller may include anywhere from 6 to 12 figures which are repeated as couples progress up and down the lines. Each time through the dance takes 64 beats, after which the pattern is repeated.(<a href ="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contra_dance">source</a>)</p>

  <h2>What do I need to do to prepare for a contra?</h2>
    <p>Contras are <em>extremely</em> beginner friendly.  All you need are comfortable shoes with a smooth sole, clothes you can move in, and a positive attitude.  But if you want to be extra-prepared, check out some moves (called figures) you're likely to encounter at a contra <a href="move_descriptions.html">here</a>.</p>

    <p>I took a look at the local contra dance website, <a href="http://sandiegocontra.org/">here</a>.  It's got huge improvements over my site, including a visually appealing presentation (pretty background colors, a changing masthead, and blocks that seem to actually change the layout of the site), as well as functional characteristics (like a menu bar, an embedded video, directions to the dance location, and up-to-date information about the local scene).  Overall it's much more pleasing to look at, and navigating the site is more intuitive.</p>
