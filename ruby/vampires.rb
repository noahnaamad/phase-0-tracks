I reversed the orders of if/elsifs as a design decision, because it made no sense to me that, for example, a someone could come in with the name "drake cula" and not be detected as a vampire if they lied well enough.  I ordered the if statements so that obvious vampire signifiers would be tested before less obvious ones.
