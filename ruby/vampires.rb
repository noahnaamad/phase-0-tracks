I reversed the orders of if/elsifs as a design decision, because it made no sense to me that, for example, a someone could come in with the name "drake cula" and not be detected as a vampire if they lied well enough.  I ordered the if statements so that obvious vampire signifiers would be tested before less obvious ones.  This is also why i split up the if/else statements, to test whether the vampire has a sunshine allergy only if they passed the more obvious tests.  Because what's the point of asking someone about their allergies if we already know they're a vampire?
