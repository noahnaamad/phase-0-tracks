In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a server that runs on a virtual machine.  A virtual machine is when an actual computer creates a program that functions exactly like a computer would, and runs that program.
Advantages include:
-cheap and easy to produce, so if something bad happens you can easily start from scratch
-you can give mutliple users access to the virtual machine, which means you're "sharing a computer" without having to literally share a physical computer.
-easily scalable because it's so easy to produce
