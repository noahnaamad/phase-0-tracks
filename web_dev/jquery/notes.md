Plan:
1) Look at the jQuery tutorial on w3schools
2) if i don't like it or finish fast, check out jQuery 101 a theodinproject (http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/jquery-basics)
3) If all else fails, check out codeacademy

What actually worked:
The jQuery tutorial on w3schools was helpful in getting me started -- especially the examples.  I soon realized that coding it out myself was the best way to make the information stick, so I made a html and js pages.  I decided on what to do, and just applied the simple things I had learned to the files.  Additional research was needed when I got stuck -- Gooogle and StackOverflow were great resources for that.
